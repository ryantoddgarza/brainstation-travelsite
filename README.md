# TravelSite

Project no. 1 of the BrainStation 2020 Full-Time Online Web Development curriculum.

## Project Overview

Taking our new skills further, this project entails creating a basic travel destination website, leveraging HTML, CSS, and component thinking.

## Tools & Resources

- Convert a creative mockup into a functional multi-page static site using HTML and CSS
- Download the mockup to get a better idea of how your project should appear

## Implementation Requirements

- You must use semantic tags where appropriate (e.g. header, footer, navbar, etc)
- All CSS must be placed in a separate stylesheet and connected to the HTML through the link tag.
- File/Folder structure must be organized and follow examples discussed in class
- Navigation Bar: The menu items must be specified using an unordered list
- Recommendations Destination Cards: Must use the `<a>` tag around the cards in order to link to the appropriate page.
- Itinerary Cards: Must use an unordered list for the itinerary activities
- Reuse as much styling and code as possible (e.g. Destination Cards and Itinerary cards), and build your project around common component code that you can reuse if possible.
- The layout of your site must use the Box Model, the CSS display property and CSS positioning including Flexbox. For this project, you should not use floats.
